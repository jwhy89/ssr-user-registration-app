## These are features I did not get to and would like to implement in the future.
There were many features that I did not get to within the short time frame. I would like to add the following features:

1. Implement global and local components to pass form data.
1. Set up Vuex for global state management.
1. Add vee-validation for form validation.
1. Hide SideNav or reorient in horizontal position on smaller screens.
1. Cancel button should clear global state and redirect to root page.
1. Bind global state to submit page.
1. Add another button to navigate back a page.
1. Add Heroku deployment instructions on readme file.
1. Fix [dockerize/main branch](https://github.com/jwhy89/ssr-user-registration-app/tree/dockerize/main) for Docker.
